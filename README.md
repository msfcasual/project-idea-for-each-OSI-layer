Custom MAC Layer Simulator
OSI Layer: Layer 2 - Data Link Layer
Language: Python
Status: Prototype / Learning Project
This project simulates a basic Media Access Control (MAC) layer protocol for multiple nodes sharing a single communication channel. It demonstrates fundamental OSI Layer 2 concepts such as carrier sensing, collision detection, and transmission coordination between nodes.

The simulator models how nodes check the channel before sending data, how collisions occur if the channel is busy, and how transmissions are serialized to avoid conflicts.
